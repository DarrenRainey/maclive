Mac Live is a Cocoa front end to xbox.com.  It can provide growl alerts when selected friends come online or when certain games are being played by your friends.

### Update ###
Install the Safari 3 beta from Apple and all Mac Live memory leaks automagically disappear!

New in V6: Accept/Reject friend requests actually works now :)

In response to the recent interest in Mac Live I have been working on improving it.  Aside from documentation, I have developed all of the features that I had hoped to be able to provide for my first official release.  At this point I'm looking at doing an official release soon (how soon depends on the bug reports I receive from users).  Below is the current feature list:

  * View friends, games, and messages
  * Notifications via growl when selected friends or selected games come online
  * Notifications via growl when messages or friend requests are received
  * Send friend requests (both via the services menu in any application and within Mac Live itself)
  * Send text messages to friends
  * Delete messages
  * Accept or Reject friend requests

If you find any bugs or you have any ideas for enhancements, please post them in the handy google code [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/maclive/issues/list).  I appreciate all of your feedback. If you don't have a google account to post issues with, you can email me at jameshoward AT mac DOT com.
